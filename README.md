Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| :car: [Auto Pedestrians Crashes Project](https://github.com/Rafik-Sebia/Auto-Pedestrians-Crashes/blob/main/auto_ped_crashes.ipynb) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | Analysis of a simple dataset about pedestrian crashes in the USA from 2010 to 2018, and answering simple questions, such as: Which year had the most pedestrian crashes? What are the degrees of injury? Are men or women more likely to be involved in these crashes? | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ |
| :computer: [Internet Usage Analysis Project](https://github.com/Rafik-Sebia/Internet-Usage-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Internet_usage_analysis.ipynb) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | Analysis of the data of internet usage [in kb] by graduate students at an Indian university. We will clean and analyze the data while answering these qustions: What time of day sees the highest rates of internet activity? How often does the IP change? How often does the device change? What is the average usage per hour, day and month? | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ |
| :movie_camera: [Top 50 Animation Movies and TV Shows Project](https://github.com/Rafik-Sebia/Top-50-Animation-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Project/blob/main/Top_50_animation_movies_and_tv_shows.ipynb) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | Analysis of a dataset of the top 50 animation movies and TV shows, which was acquired by scraping the IMDB website, and answering questions such as: Does a higher number of votes mean the movie will have a higher ranking? Is there a relationship between the runtime of a movie and its number of votes? What is the most succeful genre of movies? | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ |
| :iphone: [Top 5 Mobile Brands Amazon Project](https://github.com/Rafik-Sebia/Top-5-Mobile-Brands-Amazon-Project/blob/main/Top_5-mobile-brands-amazon-project.ipynb) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | Analysis of a dataset containing 1900+ details of the top five smartphone brands in India (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo) listed on Amazon containing necessary details such as product description, price, rating, review count, and URL. | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ |
| :hospital: [US Medical Insurance Costs](https://github.com/Rafik-Sebia/2nd-take-U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Project/blob/main/us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb) |   EDA | Analysis of a CSV file with Medical Insurance Costs using Python fundamentals. The goal of this project is to analyze various attributes within insurance.csv to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset. | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ |
| :chart_with_upwards_trend: [Life Expectancy and GDP Project](https://github.com/Rafik-Sebia/2nd-Take-on-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP/blob/main/life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb) |   EDA | Analysis of a dataset to find out if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens. The goals were to prepare data, followed by analysis with plots, and to seek to explain the findings from the study. | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ |
| :seedling: [Biodiversity Project](https://github.com/Rafik-Sebia/2nd-take-on-Biodiversity-Project/blob/main/biodiversity.ipynb) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | Analysis of data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. I performed some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and we investigated if there were any patterns or themes in the types of species that become endangered. | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ |
